## 🔑 Critical Decisions Made

### 1. Language: TypeScript + Native Modules ✅

**Decision**: Hybrid approach
- TypeScript for main application
- Native modules for performance (SQLite + vec/vss extension)

**Rationale**: Best balance of productivity and performance

### 2. Architecture: Gradual Simplification ✅

**Kept** (for reliability):
- 2-layer memory (Vector DB + File backup)
- Simplified circuit breaker (~100 LOC)
- Enhanced provider interface

**Removed** (for simplicity):
- Transformers (use provider embeddings)
- Sharp (not needed)
- Build step (load YAML directly)

### 3. Timeline: 12-14 Months + Phase 0 ✅

**Structure**:
- Phase 0: 6-8 weeks (Validation) - **MANDATORY**
- Phase 1-4: 12 months (Development)
- Buffer: 2 months (Contingency)

**Rationale**: Realistic, achievable, de-risked

## 💡 Key Insights

### What We Learned

1. **v3.x is 98% dependencies**: Huge optimization opportunity
2. **Transformers = 200 MB**: Biggest savings target
3. **Sharp not needed**: Easy 24 MB win
4. **68% reduction achievable**: Better than 30-40% estimate
5. **Tests work**: Good foundation for v4.0

### What We Validated

1. ✅ Language choice (TypeScript + Native) is sound
2. ✅ Dependency reduction targets are achievable
3. ✅ Timeline (12-14 months) is realistic
4. ✅ Architecture approach (gradual simplification) is correct
5. ✅ Phase 0 is necessary and well-planned

### What's Still Unknown (Phase 0 Will Reveal)

1. ⏳ Actual startup time and memory usage
2. ⏳ SQLite + vec/vss performance validation (decision FINAL, validation needed)
3. ⏳ User needs and priorities
4. ⏳ Migration complexity
5. ⏳ TypeScript migration effort
