## Version Management

### Versioning Scheme

**Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**:
```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-PRERELEASE+BUILD

Examples:
- 4.0.0 (Initial v4 release)
- 4.0.1 (Patch fix)
- 4.1.0 (New features, backward compatible)
- 5.0.0 (Breaking changes)
- 4.0.0-beta.1 (Beta release)
- 4.0.0-rc.1 (Release candidate)
```

**Version Increment Rules**:

1. **MAJOR** (4.x.x → 5.x.x):
   - Breaking API changes
   - Major architecture changes
   - Incompatible configuration changes
   - Requires migration

2. **MINOR** (4.0.x → 4.1.x):
   - New features (backward compatible)
   - New providers/agents
   - Performance improvements
   - Deprecations (with warnings)

3. **PATCH** (4.0.0 → 4.0.1):
   - Bug fixes
   - Security patches
   - Documentation updates
   - Performance fixes

4. **PRERELEASE**:
   - alpha: Internal testing only
   - beta: Public testing, unstable API
   - rc: Release candidate, stable API
