## 6. Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

**Risk 1: SQLite + vec/vss Performance Below Expectations (10-20% probability)**
- **Impact**: Need optimization sprint or adjusted targets
- **Mitigation**: Tune configurations, optimize implementation, adjust criteria
- **Contingency**: Add 1-2 weeks for optimization if needed

**Risk 2: User Research Low Response Rate**
- **Impact**: Decisions not informed by user needs
- **Mitigation**:
  - Offer incentives (raffle, early access)
  - Personal outreach to key users
  - Accept 10+ responses as minimum
- **Contingency**: Rely more on internal team feedback

**Risk 3: Baseline Measurements Reveal Bigger Issues**
- **Impact**: v3.x worse than assumed, targets too optimistic
- **Mitigation**: Be honest with findings, adjust targets
- **Contingency**: Revise success criteria to be realistic

**Risk 4: Phase 0 Takes Longer Than 8 Weeks**
- **Impact**: Development start delayed
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize critical path items
- **Contingency**: Acceptable to extend to 10 weeks if needed

### Medium-Risk Items

**Risk 5: Stakeholders Don't Approve Budget**
- **Impact**: Project can't proceed
- **Mitigation**: Show clear ROI, user demand
- **Contingency**: Reduce scope, phase delivery
