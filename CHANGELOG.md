- **Impact**: Significant startup performance improvement, only loads required agent
- **Location**: `src/agents/profile-loader.ts:103-137`

**BUG #2: Gemini Provider Streaming**
- **Issue**: No real-time streaming output - waited for complete response before displaying
- **Fix**: Implemented pseudo-streaming by yielding stdout chunks as they arrive (50 char chunks)
- **Impact**: Better user experience with progressive output display
- **Location**: `src/providers/gemini-provider.ts:79-151`

**BUG #3: Claude Provider Real-Time Streaming**
- **Issue**: Claude Code CLI hung when called incorrectly, no streaming support
- **Fix**:
  - Added `--print` flag for non-interactive execution
  - Added `--include-partial-messages` flag for true real-time streaming
  - Correctly parse `stream_event` with `content_block_delta` messages
  - Process incremental text deltas as they arrive
- **Impact**: Claude provider now works correctly with true real-time streaming

## [4.5.1] - 2025-10-07

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Critical Fixes for Advanced Stage Executor (Phase 3)

**Bug #1: continueOnFailure option not respected (High Severity)**
- **Issue**: AdvancedStageExecutor ignored the `continueOnFailure` option, always continuing execution after stage failures
- **Impact**: Users could not control failure behavior, inconsistent with StageExecutor
- **Fix**: Added failure checks after parallel and sequential stage execution, respecting the `continueOnFailure` flag
- **Files**: `src/agents/advanced-stage-executor.ts:247-293`

**Bug #2: Skipped stage outputs polluting downstream stages (Medium Severity)**
- **Issue**: Stages skipped due to conditions had their `'[Skipped due to condition]'` output added to `stageOutputs`, polluting downstream stage inputs
- **Impact**: Downstream stages received meaningless placeholder text as context
- **Fix**: Filter out skipped stage outputs before adding to `stageOutputs` Map
- **Files**: `src/agents/advanced-stage-executor.ts:241-245, 274-278`

**Bug #3: Missing dependency failure checks (Medium Severity)**
- **Issue**: Stages executed even when their dependencies failed, only missing the failed dependency's output
- **Impact**: Stages could execute with incomplete context, producing incorrect results
- **Fix**: Added pre-execution validation to check all dependencies succeeded; skip stage if any dependency failed
- **Files**: `src/agents/advanced-stage-executor.ts:331-365`

**Bug #4: Inaccurate previous.success condition logic (Low Severity)**
- **Issue**: `previous.success` condition only checked if `stageOutputs.size > 0`, couldn't accurately detect failures
- **Impact**: Conditional execution decisions could be incorrect
- **Fix**: Introduced `stageResults` Map to track all stage execution states; `previous.success` now accurately checks for failures
- **Files**: `src/agents/advanced-stage-executor.ts:532-564`

**Bug #5: Missing undefined stages filter (Low Severity)**
- **Issue**: Advanced features detection didn't filter potential `undefined` stages
- **Impact**: Potential TypeScript runtime errors in edge cases
- **Fix**: Added TypeScript type guard to filter undefined stages
- **Files**: `src/cli/commands/run.ts:244`

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **New Data Structure**: Added `stageResults: Map<string, StageExecutionResult>` to track all stage execution states
- **Enhanced Dependency Validation**: Early detection of dependency failures before stage execution
- **Improved Condition Evaluation**: Both `previous.success` and `stage_name.success` now based on actual execution results
- **Consistent Failure Handling**: Parallel and sequential stages both respect `continueOnFailure` option
- **Output Filtering**: Skipped stages no longer pollute downstream context

### ✅ Testing
- **All Tests Passing**: 788/788 unit tests (100% pass rate)
- **TypeScript**: All strict mode checks passing
- **Build**: Successful (237.06 KB, +3.01 KB / +1.3%)
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% - no breaking changes

### 📊 Impact
- **Bundle Size**: 237.06 KB (minimal increase of 3.01 KB for bug fixes)
- **Performance**: No performance degradation
- **Reliability**: Significantly improved error handling and execution correctness

### 📈 Migration from v4.5.0

  - name: fetch_users
    parallel: true
    dependencies: []

  - name: fetch_products
    parallel: true
    dependencies: []

  # This waits for both
  - name: join_data
    dependencies: [fetch_users, fetch_products]
```

#### Conditional Execution
```yaml
stages:
  - name: validate
    dependencies: []

  - name: process
    dependencies: [validate]
    condition: validate.success  # Only runs if validate succeeds

  - name: cleanup

# Output:
📊 Stage Dependency Graph

Level 0:
  ○ fetch_user_data [parallel]
  ○ fetch_transaction_data [parallel]

Level 1:
  ○ join_datasets
     ↳ depends on: fetch_user_data, fetch_transaction_data

Level 2:
  ○ transform_data
     ↳ depends on: join_datasets
```

### 🔍 Implementation Details

#### Dependency Graph Algorithm
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V = stages, E = dependencies
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for graph data structure
- **Algorithm**: Topological sort with level calculation
  - First pass: Build graph nodes with dependencies
  - Second pass: Calculate execution levels iteratively
  - Third pass: Detect circular dependencies via DFS
  - Fourth pass: Group stages by level for parallel execution

#### Parallel Execution Strategy
- **Level-Based Execution**: Execute stages level by level
  - Level 0: No dependencies (can all run in parallel if marked)
  - Level N: Depends on stages at level N-1 (waits for previous level)
- **Within-Level Parallelism**: Stages at same level can run concurrently
  - Filter stages marked `parallel: true`
  - Execute with `Promise.all()` for true concurrency
  - Collect results and continue to next level
- **Mixed Execution**: Same level can have both parallel and sequential stages
  - Parallel stages execute first (concurrently)
  - Sequential stages execute after (one by one)

#### Condition Evaluation
- **Simple Expression Parser**: String-based condition evaluation
  - `previous.success`: All previous stages succeeded
  - `stage_name.success`: Specific stage succeeded
  - Future: Support for complex boolean expressions
- **Graceful Skipping**: Conditions don't fail workflows
  - Stage marked as skipped (not failed)
  - Downstream stages can still execute if dependencies met
  - Final output includes skipped stages with reason

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed visibility of assembleFinalOutput**: Changed from `private` to `protected` for inheritance

- Simple multi-stage agents use StageExecutor automatically
- To use advanced features, add Phase 3 fields to your agent profile:
  ```yaml
  stages:
    - name: my_stage
      dependencies: []      # NEW: Stage dependencies
      parallel: true        # NEW: Parallel execution
      condition: "..."      # NEW: Conditional execution

### Changed - Breaking Changes from v3.x

**⚠️ v4.0 requires clean installation - no automatic migration from v3.x**

1. **Configuration Format**
   - YAML → JSON
   - New config structure
   - Manual configuration required

2. **Memory System**
   - Milvus → SQLite + vec
   - New vector extension
   - Use export/import for manual data transfer if needed

3. **Directory Structure**
   - `.defai/` → `.automatosx/`
   - Clean installation required

4. **CLI Commands**
   - New command structure
   - Different command flags
   - Review documentation for command changes

5. **Provider Interface**
   - CLI-based providers only
   - Direct API support removed (use CLI wrappers)
