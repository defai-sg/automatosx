# AutomatosX Agent Directory

AutomatosX agents have **human-friendly names** to make them easier to remember and use. Each agent has both a technical role name and a memorable display name.

## Why Names?

Research shows humans remember names better than roles. Instead of remembering "backend engineer", you can just think "ask Bob".
