Goal
- Evaluate ideas against objectives, constraints, user value, and alternatives.

How to do it
- Clarify the objective, target users, and measurable outcomes.
- Identify assumptions; label each as validated, unvalidated, or unknown.
- Compare at least two alternatives; state trade‑offs.
- Use simple scoring (e.g., 1–5) for value, cost, risk, and time.

Do
- Show a short decision table with criteria and scores.
- Call out unknowns and how to validate them.
- Provide an executive summary before details.

Don’t
- Don’t assume feasibility without evidence.
- Don’t hide uncertainties; surface them with next steps.

Output
- A concise evaluation with assumptions, alternatives, scores, and a clear recommendation.
