# Task Planning Ability

Break down complex projects into manageable tasks.

## Planning Process

1. **Understand** the goal
   - Clarify requirements
   - Identify constraints
   - Define success criteria

2. **Decompose** into tasks
   - Break into phases
   - Identify dependencies
   - Estimate effort
   - Prioritize

3. **Create** actionable steps
   - Each task should be:
     - Specific and clear
     - Measurable
     - Achievable
     - Time-bound

4. **Review** and adjust
   - Check for gaps
   - Validate estimates
   - Get stakeholder approval
   - Adjust as needed

## Task Template

```
Task: [Clear, action-oriented title]

Description:
- What needs to be done
- Why it's important
- Expected outcome

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

Estimate: [time estimate]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Dependencies: [other tasks]
```

## Prioritization Framework

**Eisenhower Matrix:**

1. Urgent + Important: Do first
2. Important + Not urgent: Schedule
3. Urgent + Not important: Delegate
4. Neither: Eliminate

**Value vs Effort:**

- High value, low effort: Quick wins
- High value, high effort: Major projects
- Low value, low effort: Fill-ins
- Low value, high effort: Avoid
