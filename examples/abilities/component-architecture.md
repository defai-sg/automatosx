# Component Architecture

## Overview
Design and implement reusable, maintainable component structures following modern frontend architecture patterns. Focus on composition, separation of concerns, and clear component hierarchies.

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each component should have one clear purpose. Avoid components that try to do too much.

### 2. Composition Over Inheritance
Build complex UIs by composing smaller, focused components rather than creating deep inheritance chains.

### 3. Container/Presentational Pattern
- **Container components**: Handle logic, state, and side effects
- **Presentational components**: Focus purely on rendering UI based on props

### 4. Props Design
- Keep props interfaces simple and explicit
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Avoid prop drilling—use context or state management for deep data

## Component Structure

```
/components
  /Button
    Button.tsx          # Component implementation
    Button.test.tsx     # Tests
    Button.stories.tsx  # Storybook stories
    index.ts            # Public exports
```

## Atomic Design

Organize components by complexity:
- **Atoms**: Button, Input, Label
- **Molecules**: FormField (Input + Label), SearchBar
- **Organisms**: LoginForm, Header, Card
- **Templates**: Page layouts
- **Pages**: Complete pages

## Best Practices

### Component Design
- Single responsibility principle
- TypeScript interfaces for props
- Proper error boundaries
- Clear naming conventions

### Performance
- Memoization where appropriate (React.memo, useMemo)
- Callback memoization (useCallback)
- Code splitting for heavy components
- Lazy loading with Suspense

### Testing
- Unit tests for component logic
- Integration tests for user interactions
- Accessibility testing
- Visual regression tests

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. God Components
Components that handle too many responsibilities

### 2. Prop Drilling
Passing props through many levels—use Context API or state management

### 3. Tight Coupling
Components depending on specific parent or child implementations

### 4. Mixed Concerns
Mixing business logic, API calls, and rendering in one component

## Component Checklist

- [ ] Single responsibility
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces for props
- [ ] Proper error boundaries
- [ ] Memoization where appropriate
- [ ] Accessibility attributes (ARIA)
- [ ] Unit tests for logic
- [ ] Integration tests for interactions
- [ ] Storybook documentation
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Code split if heavy

## Performance Considerations

### Memoization
- Memoize expensive computations (useMemo)
- Memoize callback functions (useCallback)
- Memoize components that render often (React.memo)

### Code Splitting
- Lazy load heavy components
- Use Suspense for loading states
- Route-based code splitting

### Optimization Techniques
- Virtual scrolling for long lists
- Debounce/throttle for frequent events
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use production builds
