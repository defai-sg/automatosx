Goal
- Assess technical, operational, and economic feasibility with timelines and costs.

How to do it
- Define scope, constraints, and success criteria.
- Technical: stack fit, complexity, integration risks.
- Operational: processes, skills, SLAs, compliance.
- Economic: cost drivers (build/run), ROI windows, sensitivities.

Do
- Provide a small matrix (dimension × 1–5 score) and rationale.
- Add timeline bands (e.g., 2–4 weeks, 1–2 quarters) with key assumptions.

Don’t
- Don’t present estimates without assumptions.
- Don’t ignore maintenance/operational costs.

Output
- A feasibility summary with scores, assumptions, timeline bands, and go/no‑go recommendation.
