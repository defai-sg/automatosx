# Best Practices Ability

Apply industry-standard best practices across development.

## Code Quality

1. **Readability**
   - Clear, descriptive names
   - Consistent formatting
   - Meaningful comments
   - Self-documenting code

2. **Simplicity**
   - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
   - Avoid over-engineering
   - Solve today's problem
   - Refactor when needed

3. **Maintainability**
   - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
   - SOLID principles
   - Low coupling, high cohesion
   - Modular design

4. **Reliability**
   - Error handling
   - Input validation
   - Defensive programming
   - Comprehensive testing

## Development Practices

### Version Control (Git)

- Commit often, push daily
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Use feature branches
- Review before merging
- Keep main/master deployable

### Code Review

- Review all changes
- Be constructive and respectful
- Check for bugs, style, design
- Suggest alternatives
- Approve only when ready

### Testing

- Write tests first (TDD)
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Aim for 80%+ coverage
- Fast test execution
- Fix failing tests immediately

### Security

- Never commit secrets
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow OWASP guidelines

## Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each module has one responsibility
   - Clear boundaries
   - Minimal dependencies

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Don't create dependencies internally
   - Inject through constructor/parameters
   - Easier testing and flexibility

3. **Interface-Based Design**
   - Program to interfaces, not implementations
   - Enables polymorphism
   - Facilitates testing (mocking)

4. **Configuration Over Hardcoding**
   - Use config files/environment variables
   - Don't hardcode URLs, paths, credentials
   - Environment-specific configs

## Performance

- Profile before optimizing
- Optimize bottlenecks only
- Use caching strategically
- Minimize database queries
- Lazy load when possible
- Consider asynchronous operations

## Documentation

- README for every project
- API documentation (JSDoc, OpenAPI)
- Code comments for "why"
- Architecture diagrams
- Changelog/release notes
