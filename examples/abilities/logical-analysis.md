Goal
- Analyze arguments for validity, completeness, and hidden assumptions.

How to do it
- List premises and assumptions explicitly.
- Check inference steps; note logical fallacies or gaps.
- Consider counter‑examples and edge cases.
- Separate facts (with citations) from opinions (qualified language).

Do
- Use bullet points for premises → conclusion.
- Mark each step as sound/unsound with a brief note.
- Provide a short “What would change my conclusion?” section.

Don’t
- Don’t conflate correlation with causation.
- Don’t bury key assumptions.

Output
- A compact reasoning audit: premises, inferences, counter‑points, and a confidence rating.
