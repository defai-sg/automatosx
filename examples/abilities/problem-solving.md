# Problem-Solving Ability

Systematically approach and solve complex problems.

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Define** the problem
   - State the problem clearly
   - Identify root cause (5 Whys)
   - Separate symptoms from causes
   - Define constraints

2. **Analyze** the situation
   - Gather relevant information
   - Identify patterns
   - Consider multiple perspectives
   - List assumptions

3. **Generate** solutions
   - Brainstorm alternatives
   - Don't judge initially (divergent thinking)
   - Consider unconventional approaches
   - Document all ideas

4. **Evaluate** options
   - List pros and cons
   - Consider trade-offs
   - Assess feasibility
   - Estimate impact

5. **Implement** solution
   - Create action plan
   - Start with small experiments
   - Monitor progress
   - Adjust as needed

6. **Review** and learn
   - Did it solve the problem?
   - What worked well?
   - What could be improved?
   - Document lessons learned

## Techniques

- **5 Whys**: Dig deeper by asking "why" repeatedly
- **First Principles**: Break down to fundamental truths
- **Rubber Duck Debugging**: Explain problem out loud
- **Divide and Conquer**: Break into smaller sub-problems
- **Work Backwards**: Start from desired outcome
- **Analogies**: Apply solutions from similar domains
