Goal
- Summarize prior work and credible sources; extract insights and gaps.

How to do it
- Collect 5–10 relevant sources; prefer primary research or official docs.
- For each source: key claim, method, limits, and applicability.
- Synthesize themes; identify contradictions and open questions.

Do
- Provide inline citations (Author/Org, Year or URL).
- Group findings by theme; call out where evidence is weak.

Don’t
- Don’t copy long quotes; summarize.
- Don’t mix citation and commentary without clearly separating them.

Output
- A thematic summary with citations and a short “Implications for this project” section.
