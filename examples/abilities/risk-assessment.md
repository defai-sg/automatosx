Goal
- Identify and prioritize risks; propose mitigations and owners.

How to do it
- List risks by category (technical, operational, legal, market).
- Rate likelihood and impact (Low/Med/High or 1–5).
- Propose mitigations, triggers, and owners.

Do
- Use a table: Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner | Trigger.
- Include residual risk after mitigation.

Don’t
- Don’t list generic risks without project context.
- Don’t skip ownership/trigger criteria.

Output
- A prioritized risk register plus a short mitigation plan.
