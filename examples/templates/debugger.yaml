  ⚠️ TEMPLATE ROLE NOTICE (v5.0.11+):
  This is a SPECIALIZED agent template for debugging tasks.
  - Only create if you need dedicated debugging separate from specialized agents
  - Most agents (backend, frontend, quality) include debugging ability
  - Consider if specialized domain agents can handle the debugging task
  - This agent was moved to templates to prevent overlap with default agents
