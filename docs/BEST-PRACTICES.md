# AutomatosX Best Practices Guide

**Version**: 5.3.4
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-14
**Target Audience**: Claude Code users, CLI users, developers

---

## üéØ Core Philosophy

**AutomatosX is designed for intelligent collaboration, not just command execution.**

The most powerful way to use AutomatosX is to **let Claude Code think and plan**, then **let specialized agents execute**. This collaborative approach combines Claude Code's reasoning with agent expertise.

---

## üöÄ Quick Decision Guide

### When to Use Natural Language Collaboration (Recommended 80%)

**Use**: `"please work with ax agent to..."`

‚úÖ **Best For**:
- Complex, multi-step tasks
- Tasks requiring project context analysis
- Tasks needing coordination between multiple agents
- Tasks where you want Claude Code to plan the approach
- Tasks that might need iteration or error handling
- When you're not sure which agent is best

‚ùå **Not Ideal For**:
- Simple, single-step tasks with clear requirements
- Quick prototypes where speed matters most
- When you've already analyzed and just need execution

### When to Use Slash Commands (Express 20%)

**Use**: `/ax:agent <name>, <task>`

‚úÖ **Best For**:
- Simple, well-defined single tasks
- Quick code generation or review
- When you know exactly which agent to use
- Rapid prototyping and experimentation

‚ùå **Not Ideal For**:
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Tasks requiring project context
- Tasks needing coordination
- When you're exploring solutions

## üìñ Natural Language Collaboration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Analysis & Implementation

**Scenario**: You want to implement a feature but need analysis first.

```
‚úÖ Good: "please work with ax agent to analyze our authentication
         system and implement JWT token refresh"

Why it works:
- Claude Code reads your auth code
- AutomatosX selects the best agent automatically (backend, security)
- Provides full context to agent
- Validates the implementation
```

**vs.**

```
‚ùå Less Effective: /ax:agent backend, add JWT refresh to auth

Why it's less effective:
- Agent doesn't know your current auth implementation
- No context about your project structure
- No validation of the approach
- System can't select a better agent if needed
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Agent Coordination

**Scenario**: A task needs multiple specialists.

```
‚úÖ Good: "please work with ax agent to design a secure API authentication system"

Result:
- Claude Code analyzes requirements
- AutomatosX selects appropriate agents (backend, security)
- Agents collaborate on the design
- Claude Code synthesizes the results
```

**vs.**

```
‚ùå Less Effective:
/ax:agent backend, design API auth
[wait for result]
/ax:agent security, review this design
[wait for result]
[manually combine the feedback]

Why it's less effective:
- Manual coordination required
- No automatic context sharing
- More time-consuming
- Risk of missing important feedback
```

### Pattern 3: Planning & Execution

**Scenario**: Complex feature with multiple steps.

```
‚úÖ Good: "please work with ax agent to refactor our user management module"

What happens:
1. Claude Code analyzes current code
2. Identifies affected components
3. AutomatosX selects relevant agents (backend, frontend, database)
4. Plans refactoring strategy
5. Validates each step
6. Provides unified summary
```

**vs.**

```
‚ùå Less Effective: /ax:agent backend, refactor user management

Why it's less effective:
- No planning phase
- Misses frontend/database impacts
- No validation of approach
```

### Pattern 4: Problem Solving

**Scenario**: Debugging or investigation.

```
‚úÖ Good: "please work with ax agent to investigate why our
         API response times increased by 300ms"

What happens:
1. Claude Code examines logs, metrics, code
2. Selects appropriate agents (backend, devops)
3. Agents analyze from their perspectives
4. Claude Code synthesizes findings
5. Proposes solutions
```

### Pattern 5: Learning & Exploration

**Scenario**: Understanding unfamiliar code or technology.

```
‚úÖ Good: "please work with ax agent to help me understand
         how our caching layer works and suggest improvements"

Benefits:
- Claude Code provides high-level overview
- Agent provides deep technical analysis
- Combined explanation is more comprehensive
```

## ‚ö° When to Use Slash Commands

### Ideal Scenarios

#### 1. Quick Code Generation
```
‚úÖ /ax:agent backend, write a function to validate email addresses
```

#### 2. Fast Code Review
```
‚úÖ /ax:agent quality, review this function:
   [paste code]
```

#### 3. Simple Queries
```
‚úÖ /ax:agent backend, what's the best way to handle file uploads in Express?
```

#### 4. Rapid Prototyping
```
‚úÖ /ax:agent frontend, create a React component for a user profile card
```

### When to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't use slash commands when**:
- You need to analyze existing code first
- Multiple agents need to coordinate
- Task requires planning or iteration
- You're not sure which agent is best
- Task has multiple steps

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Let Claude Code Choose the Agent

Instead of:
```
‚ùå /ax:agent backend, help with this database query
```

Try:
```
‚úÖ "please work with ax agent to optimize this slow database query"
```

Claude Code will:
- Examine the query and schema
- Choose backend or data-scientist agent appropriately
- Provide full context

### Tip 2: Combine Analysis with Execution

Instead of:
```
‚ùå Step 1: Read the code yourself
‚ùå Step 2: /ax:agent backend, implement [feature]
```

Try:
```
‚úÖ "please work with ax agent to review our current
    implementation and add [feature]"
```

### Tip 3: Let AutomatosX Coordinate Complex Tasks

Instead of:
```
‚ùå /ax:agent backend, build a complete auth system
```

Try:
```
‚úÖ "please work with ax agent to design and implement
    a complete authentication system"
```

AutomatosX will automatically select and coordinate the right agents (backend, security, frontend, quality) based on the task requirements.

### Tip 4: Iterate with Context

Natural language collaboration makes iteration easier:

```
First iteration:
"please work with ax agent to implement user login"

[Review results]

Second iteration:
"please work with ax agent to add password reset functionality
 to the login system we just built"

Benefits:
- AutomatosX selects agents with context from previous work
- Claude Code maintains the conversation thread
- More coherent and consistent results
```

### Tip 5: Request Explanations

```
‚úÖ "please work with ax agent to implement caching,
    and explain the trade-offs of different caching strategies"
```

Claude Code + AutomatosX agents provide better explanations than either alone, with the system automatically selecting the most knowledgeable agent for the topic.
