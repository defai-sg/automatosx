# Introduction

Welcome to **AutomatosX v4.0** - a modern AI agent orchestration platform built with TypeScript. AutomatosX helps you build, manage, and scale AI agents with a simple, powerful, and developer-friendly approach.

## What is AutomatosX?

AutomatosX is a platform that makes it easy to:

- **Build AI Agents**: Define agents using simple YAML profiles and Markdown abilities
- **Manage Memory**: Store and retrieve agent memories with vector search
- **Orchestrate Providers**: Use multiple AI providers (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI) with automatic fallback
- **Scale Efficiently**: Optimized performance with caching and lazy loading

## Key Features

### üöÄ Modern TypeScript Architecture

Built from the ground up with TypeScript for type safety, better tooling, and excellent developer experience.

```typescript
import { AutomatosX } from 'automatosx';

const agent = new AutomatosX({
  profile: 'assistant',
  memory: true
});

const response = await agent.run('Help me with this task');
```

### üß† Advanced Memory System

Powered by SQLite + vec for efficient vector search with minimal overhead:

- **Lightning Fast**: 0.72ms average query latency
- **Lightweight**: 2-5MB database size (efficient storage)
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant memories by meaning, not just keywords
- **Export/Import**: Backup and restore your agent's memory

### üîå Multi-Provider Support

Seamlessly integrate with multiple AI providers:

- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **Gemini** (Google)
- **OpenAI** (GPT models)
- **Custom Providers** (extend easily)

Features:

- Automatic fallback on failures
- Load balancing across providers
- Cost optimization with caching (30-40% API reduction)

### üìù Profile-Based Agent Definition

Define agents with simple YAML profiles:

```yaml
# .automatosx/agents/assistant.yaml
name: assistant
version: 1.0.0
description: A helpful AI assistant

model:
  provider: claude
  command: claude
  temperature: 0.7

system: |
  You are a helpful AI assistant. Be concise and accurate.

abilities:
  - web-search
  - code-analysis
  - file-operations
```

And Markdown abilities:

```markdown
# Web Search

Search the web for information.

## Usage

search(query: string): SearchResult[]

## Example

search("Latest AI news")
```

### üîí Security First

- **Path Validation**: Prevents path traversal attacks
- **Workspace Isolation**: Agents can only write to their workspace
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated
- **Resource Limits**: File size limits, rate limiting
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging

## Why v4.0?

### Key Improvements

- **Bundle Size**: <50MB (lightweight installation)
- **Dependencies**: 158 packages (minimal footprint)
- **Startup Time**: ~280ms (fast startup)
- **Memory Usage**: 57MB (efficient runtime)
- **API Efficiency**: 30-40% reduction in API calls via caching
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript strict mode
- **Tests**: 705 tests, 100% passing

## Use Cases

### 1. Personal Assistant

Build a personal AI assistant that remembers conversations and helps with tasks:

```bash
npx @defai.sg/automatosx chat assistant
> Help me plan my week
> Remind me what we discussed yesterday
> Draft an email to my team
```

### 2. Code Analysis

Analyze codebases and answer questions about code:

```bash
npx @defai.sg/automatosx run code-analyzer "What does the Router class do?"
npx @defai.sg/automatosx run code-analyzer "Find all TypeScript errors"
```

### 3. Research Agent

Conduct research and summarize findings:

```bash
npx @defai.sg/automatosx run researcher "Summarize recent AI advancements"
npx @defai.sg/automatosx run researcher "Compare vector databases"
```

### 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration

Coordinate multiple agents for complex tasks:

```bash
npx @defai.sg/automatosx run orchestrator "Plan and execute a project"
# Coordinates: planner, researcher, developer, reviewer
```
