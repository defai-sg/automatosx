### migrate-agent.sh
**Status**: Archived (2025-10-15)
**Purpose**: Migrate agents between teams
**Reason for archiving**: Rarely used, not part of regular workflow

**Usage** (if needed):
```bash
./tools/archive/migrate-agent.sh --agent <name> --to <team>
```

**Note**: This tool is fully functional but has been archived as it's not part of the regular development workflow. It can be moved back to `tools/` if needed frequently.

**Archival Policy**: Tools are moved here if they are:
1. No longer part of the regular workflow
2. Not referenced in package.json scripts
3. Still potentially useful for special cases
4. Fully functional and documented
